# Hi, I'm Parneet Kaur 👋

I'm a Data Engineer and ML enthusiast pursuing an MS in Computer Science at ASU (Expected 2027). I specialize in building scalable data pipelines, machine learning models, and actionable dashboards using Python, Spark, AWS, and Power BI.
I love optimizing SQL queries, automating data workflows, and designing efficient data models that power analytics and business intelligence solutions.


🌟 **Currently working on**: Optimizing ML models and ETL workflows - developing scalable pipelines to process structured and unstructured data across Azure and AWS platforms for real-time analytics.
Deepening my skills in data modeling, cloud data warehousing (Snowflake, Redshift), and exploring streaming architectures like Kafka and Spark.


## 🛠️ Skills
- **Languages & Tools**: Python, Java, SQL, Apache Spark, Kafka, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Cloud & Platforms**: AWS (S3, Redshift, Glue, Lambda), Azure, Power BI, Tableau
- **ML & Analytics**: Statistical Analysis, A/B Testing, Predictive Modeling, Data Visualization

## 💼 Experience
**Programmer Analyst @ Cognizant** (2022–2025)
- Built scalable data pipelines with Kafka and Spark, processing 1M+ records daily.
- Automated workflows with Python and UiPath, reducing manual effort by 17%.

## 📈 Featured Projects
- **[YouTube Data Analysis](https://github.com/parneet-11/YouTube-Data-Analysis)**: Developed ETL pipelines with AWS Redshift and QuickSight dashboards for video performance insights.
- **[Cloud Lakehouse Analytics](https://github.com/parneet-11/Spotify-Data-Engineering-Project)**: Developed Medallion Lakehouse on Azure Databricks. Modeled analytics data using a SCD Type 2 star schema in Azure SQL DB, with CI/CD via Databricks Asset Bundles and Unity Catalog for governance and security.
